00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.190
Congratulations on completing this

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.830
course! Let's quickly recap what we

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.730
covered in this course. In module 1, we

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.559
went over a number of exciting and

5
00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.500
motivating applications of deep learning.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.269
We also briefly covered neurons and

7
00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.100
neural networks in the brain to

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.410
appreciate how they inspire artificial

9
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.869
neural networks, and then we learned how

10
00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.119
neural networks make predictions through

11
00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.330
the forward propagation process. In

12
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.550
module 2, we learned how an artificial

13
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.740
neural network learns through gradient

14
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.170
descent and backpropagation. We also

15
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.670
learned about the vanishing gradient

16
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.219
problem, and which activation functions

17
00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.719
are best to overcome this problem. In

18
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.879
module 3, we learnt about the Keras

19
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.160
library and how to use it to build

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.800
models for regression and classification

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.000
problems. In module 4, we learned about

22
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.340
supervised and unsupervised deep neural

23
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.800
networks, and we used the Keras library

24
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.260
to build a convolutional neural network.

25
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.080
Finally, I really

26
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.260
enjoyed putting this course together, and

27
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.659
so I really hope that you enjoyed it and

28
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.159
learned a lot from it.

29
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.820
It was difficult for me at some point,

30
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.500
because I had to leave out a lot of

31
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.800
details in order to keep it simple. The

32
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.120
point of this course was not to teach you

33
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.160
everything but to teach you enough to be

34
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.900
ready for more advanced courses on

35
00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.100
deep learning, and to even start

36
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.720
learning independently if you wish. And I

37
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.020
think that you are there now. Thank you

38
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660
for taking this course and I wish you

39
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.200
the best of luck!
